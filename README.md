# 👋 Hey, I’m Michael Miller  

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  

I’m a **Software Developer** who enjoys building clean, performant web apps that not only *work* well but also *feel* great to use. I’m constantly tinkering with new projects — from frontend experiments with React and Tailwind, to backend solutions with Node.js and AWS.  

✨ My focus:
- **Frontend Development**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS,  
- **Backend Work**: Node.js, REST APIs  
- **UI/UX & Performance**: Clean code, smooth interactions, scalable design with Figma 🎨  

🚀 What I’m working on right now:
- Re-hosting and polishing older projects so they’re easier to explore.  
- Building an **e-commerce dashboard** to show off data visualization, user management, and complex state handling.

## 🎨 Fun Facts  
- ✈️ I was a USAF Loadmaster on the C-17 Globemaster III (yes, the giant cargo planes 🚛✈️).  
- 🔧 I’ve also worked HVAC — so whether it’s air systems or full-stack systems, I can keep things running cool.  
- 🎸 When I’m not coding, I’m usually playing guitar, ⛳️ golfing or geeking out over design details.
